    "# MCMC. Bayesian Inference\n",
    "The bayesian inference problem is to infer posterior distribution given prior distribution and likelihood:\n",
    "$$p(\\theta|X)=\\frac{p(X|\\theta)p(\\theta)}{\\int_\\theta p(X|\\theta)p(\\theta)d\\theta}$$\n",
    "In case of simple distributions bayesian inference can be performed analytically. However, in case of complicated distributions an explicit inference is intractable (because of denominator) and some more sophisticated techniques were designed. One of them is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. It does not provides an option to perform a bayesian inference but helps to sample from the distribution (e.g., posterior) given that distribution up to a constant (denominator)"
